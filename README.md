# Calculator Application

This is a simple calculator application developed using JavaFX. The calculator supports basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square root calculation, and more.

## Project Description

The project was developed using **JavaFX** and **Scene Builder** for creating the graphical user interface. The main components of the interface were created through Scene Builder, while the calculator logic was written manually.

### Features:
- Basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Exponentiation, square root, and absolute value operations.
- Support for inputting numbers, decimal points, and parentheses.
- A toggleable upper panel with additional functions.
- Ability to handle negative numbers and percentages.

## How the application works

1. Upon launch, the calculator displays the main window with buttons for entering numbers and operations.
2. When buttons are pressed, the numbers or operations appear in the output field.
3. The upper panel is hidden by default and can be revealed by pressing a button to add additional functions, such as exponentiation or square root.
4. When entering a value or expression, the calculator displays the result or an error if the operation is not possible (e.g., division by zero).

## Work on the project

Due to my busy work schedule and limited time, I was unable to complete the project by the deadline. However, I tried my best to fulfill the task and learn new technologies like JavaFX, improving my skills.

Some parts of the backend were researched online to solve certain problems, as I didn’t have enough time to thoroughly study every aspect of the project.

I wrote as much code as I could, and although I believe there might be errors in the project, I’m confident that my skills are improving with each step. This project has been a great opportunity to enhance my skills and better understand how to work with JavaFX and event handling in graphical interfaces.
